    "This textbook is the result of my search for a book that combines a mathematically rigorous treatment of probability and statistics with applications in Python: I could not find such a textbook, so I wrote one. (Or, depending on when you are reading this, I am in the _process_ of writing one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended audience is upper-level undergraduate students majoring in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and other STEM disciplines that make heavy use of statistical concepts and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the mathematical side, I assume that the reader has completed the calculus sequence typical at most US universities, up to and including multivariable calculus. Some basic matrix algebra will be required here and there, but not enough to justify an entire course in linear algebra as a prerequisite.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* On the programming side, I assume that the reader knows only the basics of Python and writing code in Jupyter notebooks. Nothing advanced is needed---just a familiarity with the fundamental data structures in the language, as well as basic logic, control flow, and functions. The big libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels, _etc_.) will be introduced throughout the course.\n",

    "## How to use this book\n",
    "\n",
    "The supporting material for this book is contained in a public GitHub repository linked [here](https://github.com/jmyers7/stats-book-materials). This repository is also accessible from any page in the book by clicking the GitHub link near the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is written to suit how I _actually teach_ in the classroom:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each chapter is divided into sections. Depending on length, a few sections might be covered each class period.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The sections contain boxes for all the important definitions and theorems connected with exposition and explanation, just as one would expect. However, the text itself contains almost no examples or worked problems; in their place, the reader will discover many boxes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{admonition} Problem Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "    Do problems 8-9 on the worksheet.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The worksheets that these Problem Prompts point to are contained in the GitHub repository I linked above. There is one worksheet per chapter, they are printed out and distributed to the students, and we complete them together as a class. By handing out worksheets with example problems printed out, I don't have to waste time in writing problem statements on the board.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The public repository also contains solutions to the worksheets, but these tend to be quite concise. The brevity of these written solutions is mitigated by the fact that the students and I will have discussed the worksheet problems in depth during class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every line of Python code used to produce the content in the book is included for the reader in drop-down code cells; for example:"

    "* However, I believe the task of learning the mathematical theory _and_ its computer implementation is made more difficult if both are attempted to be learned _simultaneously_. Therefore, the textbook itself does not explain the Python implementations; rather, these are left to the programming assignments in the Jupyter notebooks contained in the GitHub repository. These notebooks contain ample guidance in the markdown cells, which is also supplemented by in-class demonstrations during which I introduce the programming assignments.\n",
